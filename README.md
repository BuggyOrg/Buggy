Buggy
=====

A *special* Development-Framework (there is more to come soon.. we hope)

Version
=======

Buggy is already in it's third iteration. We startet with a humble goal and had a lot of ideas that could be possible with a cleaner design. We hope version 3 will fulfil at least some of our expectations.
