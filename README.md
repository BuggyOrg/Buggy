Buggy
=====

A *special* Development-Framework (there is more to come soon.. we hope)

General Idea
=============

With **Buggy** we want to adress several problems of modern programming languages like avoiding manual parallelization effort and simpe exchangeability of code parts without redesigning. But the major philosophy behind Buggy is to develop a tool that lets programmer write programs /program parts that are highly reusable and shareable.

Version
=======

Buggy is already in it's third iteration. We startet with a humble goal and had a lot of ideas that could be possible with a cleaner design. We hope version 3 will fulfil at least some of our expectations.

License
=======

Buggy is released under GPL v3, see the License file (https://raw2.github.com/LittleHelicase/Buggy/master/LICENSE).
