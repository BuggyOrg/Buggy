# Buggy Page

To build you need `npm` and `grunt-cli`. Simply run

`grunt`

And all HTML files will be updated. The source refs are taken from the
github repository (the repo will be cloned into .buggy_files for this).

You can specify a local Buggy copy to search for refs by creating the file
`.buggy-source-path` in the root directory of this repo. Simply add the
path to your local copy (only the path nothing else!).
